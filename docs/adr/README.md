# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for code-context-agent.

ADRs document significant architectural decisions made during development, including the context that motivated the decision, the decision itself, and its consequences.

## Format

We follow [Michael Nygard's ADR format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):

- **Title**: ADR-NNNN: Short descriptive title
- **Date**: When the decision was made or recorded
- **Status**: Current lifecycle state
- **Context**: What forces or constraints led to this decision
- **Decision**: What we decided and why
- **Consequences**: What results from this decision (positive, negative, neutral)

## Status Lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **proposed** | Under discussion, not yet accepted |
| **accepted** | Approved and in effect |
| **deprecated** | No longer recommended but still in use |
| **superseded** | Replaced by a newer ADR (link to replacement) |

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `template.md` to `NNNN-short-title.md` (next sequential number)
2. Fill in all sections with concrete technical detail
3. Set status to `proposed`
4. Submit for review; update status to `accepted` when approved
5. If a decision replaces an older one, update the old ADR's status to `superseded by ADR-NNNN`

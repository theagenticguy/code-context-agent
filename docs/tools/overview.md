# Tools Overview

code-context-agent ships with **27 built-in tools** plus runtime MCP tools from GitNexus (6+) and context7 (2), organized into 7 categories. An **11-tool MCP server** is also available for external AI clients. The Strands coordinator agent selects and orchestrates tools automatically based on the codebase being analyzed.

## Tool Inventory

| [**Search**](search.md) | 1 | `tools/search/tools.py` | BM25-ranked full-text search |
| [**Git**](git.md) | 7 | `tools/git.py` | Temporal analysis, coupling, authorship |
| [**Shell**](shell.md) | 1 | `tools/shell_tool.py` | Security-hardened command execution |
| **Orchestration** | 1 | `strands_tools.graph` | Multi-agent DAG execution |
| **Built-in total** | **27** | | |
| **GitNexus MCP** | 6+ | Runtime via `npx gitnexus mcp` | Structural code intelligence |
| **context7 MCP** | 2 | Runtime via `npx @upstash/context7-mcp` | Library documentation lookup |

All tool inputs are validated for security. Path parameters pass through traversal prevention, glob patterns are checked for injection characters, and search patterns are validated for length and syntax. See [Security](../security/overview.md) for details.

## Coordinator {: #coordinator }

## Git

Seven tools for git history analysis. See [Git History](git.md) for full documentation.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `git_hotspots` | Identify frequently changed files (change hotspots) |
| `git_files_changed_together` | Find files that frequently co-change (coupling detection) |
| `git_blame_summary` | Authorship summary for a file |
| `git_file_history` | Commit history for a specific file |
| `git_contributors` | Repository contributor statistics |
| `git_recent_commits` | Recent commits across the repository |
| `git_diff_file` | Unified diff for a specific file |

## Shell

One security-hardened shell tool. See [Shell](shell.md) for full documentation.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `shell` | Bounded command execution with program allowlist and git read-only enforcement |

## Orchestration

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `graph` | Multi-agent DAG execution from `strands_tools` |

## GitNexus MCP

Six tools provided by the [GitNexus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitnexus) MCP server at runtime. These provide structural code intelligence via a Tree-sitter-powered knowledge graph. Enabled when `CODE_CONTEXT_GITNEXUS_ENABLED=true` (default) and `npx` is available.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gitnexus_query` | Find code by concept (returns execution flows ranked by relevance) |
| `gitnexus_context` | 360-degree view of a symbol (callers, callees, process participation) |
| `gitnexus_impact` | Blast radius analysis before editing a symbol |
| `gitnexus_detect_changes` | Pre-commit scope check (verify only expected symbols changed) |
| `gitnexus_cypher` | Custom Cypher queries against the knowledge graph |
| `gitnexus_list_repos` | List repositories indexed by GitNexus |

## context7 MCP

Two tools provided by the [context7](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upstash/context7-mcp) MCP server for library documentation lookup. Enabled when `CODE_CONTEXT_CONTEXT7_ENABLED=true` (default) and `npx` is available.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `context7_resolve-library-id` | Resolve a library name to a context7 library identifier |
| `context7_query-docs` | Query documentation for a resolved library |

## How Tools Are Selected

The coordinator agent reads the **heuristic summary** produced by the deterministic indexer, then dispatches specialist Swarm teams with tool subsets tailored to their mandate:

1. **Indexer** -- Deterministic pipeline builds file manifest, GitNexus graph, git hotspots, static scan findings, and heuristic summary
2. **Coordinator reads heuristic summary** -- Plans teams based on codebase size, community count, health signals
3. **Scout teams** -- Light tools (`gitnexus_query`, `git_hotspots`, `rg_search`) survey areas quickly
4. **Deep teams** -- Full tools (`gitnexus_context`, `gitnexus_impact`, `read_file_bounded`) investigate flagged areas
5. **Bundle writing** -- Coordinator cross-references team findings and writes narrative bundles
